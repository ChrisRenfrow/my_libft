# my_libft
My ever-growing custom C library

## What is my_libft?
This project represents my solution to the first mandatory assignment at 42, libft. If you are a student at 42 and you are looking at this for a quick grade, I wish you the best of luck, because you'll need it.

## Why build my_libft?
I wanted to continue using this as a growing source of useful and ever-improving custom C functions.

## Goal for project
I would like to add many more functions as I create them in my day to day projects, possibly splitting them up into seperate libraries at some point.
